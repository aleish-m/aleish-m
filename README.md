# Hello!

My name is Aleisha. 

I enjoy problem-solving while creating something for an end user. I enjoy the challenge of the creation process and thinking through how the end user will use a product to satisfy their needs. The number of opportunities to do this with Software Engineering is exciting due to how interwoven technology is in day-to-day life.

I love finding solutions utilizing math, design, and experiences. I enjoy working with others to solve problems and bring ideas to fruition using technical, detail-oriented skills. I thrive in roles that require organized, creative, and detailed thought processes with continuous problem-solving and changing priorities.

In my free time, I enjoy:
  - :fork_and_knife: learning more about cooking, 
  - :bath: making soap and body care products, 
  - :wine_glass: winemaking, 
  - and crocheting. 

I also like to spend time with friends and family:
  - :coffee: coffee with friends, 
  - :clapper: movie nights with friends
  - :cherry_blossom: gardening, 
  - :pizza: hosting dinners, 
  - :game_die: and playing board games.
